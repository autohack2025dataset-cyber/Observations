## Application of the IDS Logic
Please note that the files provided in the `/ids_pseudocode/` directory are **pseudo-code**, representing the core logic of our proposed Intrusion Detection System. They are not directly executable scripts.

To understand how this logic evaluates the **Autohack 2025 Dataset**, please follow these logical steps described in our paper:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** [간단한 전처리 과정 설명, 예: Feature extraction based on Algorithm 1.]
2. **IDS Evaluation:** Apply the pseudo-code (`ids_core_logic.txt`) to the preprocessed dataset to detect anomalous patterns.
3. **Observation:** The expected results and observations from this process are detailed in the `observations_summary.md` file.
